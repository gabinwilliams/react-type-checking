# react-type-checking

## Description

This small project built to experiment with using type checking and validation in react without typeScript

## Instructions

1. Open up your editor of choice for and clone this repo and run an `npm install`
2. Open terminal in your editor and type `npm start` to start up the client.
3. Navigate to `App.js` and play with the props being passed into the card component.  You can change name prop to a number and see how `prop-types` npm package gives you an error in the console telling you a string was expect for name, but you are passing in a number.
5. Navigate to `Card.jsx` to see the Card.propTypes obj.  Here you can change the expected types, and whether they are required or not.
6. Run `npm start` in your terminal to launch the app locally.
